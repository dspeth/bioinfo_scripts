## wrapper shell scripts used in metagenome analyses with anvi'o

These two scripts can be used to facilitate manual binning or bin inspection with anvi'o. 
I originally wrote these when snakemake workflows weren't available for anvi'o, so their utility has likely been superseded.
That said, they have proven useful to me.


### requirements
These scripts were always written for specific use on the server I used myself, and will not work out of the box. 
They require an installation of conda, and environments called "assembly", "read_mapping", and "anvio_7".
Software called is spades, coverm, and anvio.
