bioinfo_scripts
===============

a collection of scripts I have used in bioinformatic analyses, mostly file (re)formatting

They work for me, and others are free to use them, but I cannot guarantee any usability. 

Some scripts work with the output of the CLC genomics workbench, which is commercial (expensive) software. 
Feel free to adapt them to your needs, but you are probably better off writing your own. 
I'm not a shining example of scripting..

any questions or comments are welcome
